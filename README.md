# Programming Workshop Hands-On Coding Examples

This repository has hands-on coding activities developed at my Programming Workshop course. 

In this course, the students had to develop a game using a Pygame-based framework called Universe, developed by me. A repository only for this little and simple (but funcional) framework can be found at https://github.com/helioh2/pygame-universe

An example of project that resulted from this course can be found at: https://github.com/krepper/ZumbieInvaders
